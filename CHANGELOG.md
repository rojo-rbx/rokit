# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## `Unreleased`

### Changed

- Modified the `rokit install` command to check if Rokit is in the user's PATH after installation, and provide appropriate instructions based on the user's operating system and shell ([#92])

[#92]: https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rokit/pull/92

## `1.0.0` - November 13th, 2024

Given that Rokit is already used in production by many Roblox developers, and many months have passed with no new major issues, it is time to release version `1.0.0`.

This comes with a couple guarantees:

- We will not be making any breaking changes to Rokit in the foreseeable future, and if we do, we will release a new major version.
- Rokit's tool storage & tool artifact selection algorithms are stable, and safe to rely on in production environments.
- New features and subcommands may still be added, as long as they do not break existing functionality.

As always, run `rokit self-update` to update to the latest version of Rokit! ðŸš€

### Changed

- Changed tool downloading to prefer compressed artifacts over uncompressed ones for quicker downloads ([#76])

### Fixed

- Fixed Rokit not being recognized as in PATH for `system-info` and `self-install` commands, unnecessarily prompting the user to restart ([#74])
- Fixed tools such as `lefthook`, with compatible and incompatible artifacts within the same release, not installing correctly ([#76])

## `0.0.3` - April 23rd, 2024

### Fixed

- Fixed tools installed by Rokit not being usable on Windows ([#10])

[#10]: https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rokit/pull/10

## `0.0.2` - April 2nd, 2024

### Breaking Changes

Tools are now stored in a case-insensitive manner to prevent unnecessary downloading and linking of duplicate tool specifications. This means that tools in manifests that are not all lowercase may no longer work on case-sensitive filesystems. To fix this, remove the `~/.rokit/tool-storage` directory, and Rokit will re-download and install tools next time you run `rokit install`.

### Fixed

- Fixed tool aliases being case-sensitive
- Fixed Rokit process being killed during self-update
- Fixed common tool name shortcuts in the CLI being case-sensitive
- Fixed tool storage and tool trust cache being case-sensitive

## `0.0.1` - March 31st, 2024

### Added

- Added new `authenticate` subcommand to add auth tokens for GitHub and future artifact providers.

### Fixed

- Fixed `self-install` failing to add Rokit to `$PATH` if some shell configuration files don't exist. ([#2])
